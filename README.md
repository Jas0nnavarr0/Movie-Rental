# Movie-Rental-Database
This is a full stack movie rental web application built using React + Vite for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL for the database. This program allows users to create an account and log in, browse movies, rent movies, leave reviews, and more.

In terms of dependencies we used: 
axios, react, react-dom, react-router-dom, react-redux, tailwindcss, and vite for the front end(package.json). 

For backend(pom.xml) dependencies we used:
spring-boot-starter-webmvc
spring-boot-starter-webmvc
mysql-connector-j
lombok

Now to set up the project you want to make sure your database, frontend, and backend are all running as intended.
To create the database open MySQL workbench and create a schema named moviedb. Then run the sql schema

For the back end set up make sure you have Java 17 or higher as well as Maven installed. Then you can run it through terminal.

For the front end install dependencies and start the dev server by typing npm run dev into terminal.
